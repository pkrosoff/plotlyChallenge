<h3>Plotly Homework Assignment</h3>
<br><br>
This website illustrates the biodiverstiy of microbes (referred henceforth as operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) that are present in human navels in a study in an interactive dashboard.
<br><br>
On this website, you will be able to select a Test Subject referenced by their ID number from the dropdown menu near the upper left side of the page below the jumbotron header. Once selected, the subjects demographic information should populate in the box below as well as two visualizations. 
<br><br>
The first visualization will show the top 10 OTUs found in the individual's bellybutton sample as a horizontal bar chart in descending order of population. The numberic ID of the OTUs will be marked on the y-axis, and their prevalence in the sample will be indicated along the x-axis. Hovering your cursor above each horizontal bar will show the labels for the OTUs. 
<br><br>
The second visualzation is a bubble graph that will show all OTU populations, rather than the top ten most prevalent. The bubble size will indicate relative frequency that the sample was found and measured in the test subject. The color reflects the different groupings of OTU ID numbers. Hovering over each bubble will reveal more information about that particular microbial species.

Enjoy!

Trying to get my github pages to work by adjusting the readme, hope this works!
